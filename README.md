##Doc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jghibiki/Doc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jghibiki/Doc)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/jghibiki/Doc/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/jghibiki/Doc?branch=master)

Hopefully a much simpler replacement for [Mopey](https://github.com/jghibiki/mopey).
Because mopey kind of sucks due to it's dependence on mopidy-youtube, and mopey sound like it should be one of the seven dwarves (it's not) but Doc is.

There is a command line client for the NDSU ACM doc instance, this client can be customized to use a custom install by editing the ```baseUrl``` property. How to install client:
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jghibiki/Doc/master/doc
chmod +x doc
sudo cp ./doc /bin/doc
```
